# Unity 2D Demo Project

This is a simple **Unity 2D demo** for the **SheCodeâ€™s Game Dev SLP**.  

This is designed to help the team learn **Git and GitHub** in a Unity workflow â€” including cloning a repo, creating branches, committing changes, and pushing updates.

Each student will add a 2D sprite to the shared scene and push their changes on their own branch.

## Goal
Practice version control and collaboration in Unity while building a shared 2D scene.

## Tech
- Unity 2022.3.62f2 LTS  
- Git + GitHub
